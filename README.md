# CODSOFT
I've been selected for a month-long virtual web development internship. I need to complete three tasks to complete the internship successfully. I've listed the tasks below:

1) Portfolio Website

2) Landing Page (visit site: https://codsoft-henna.vercel.app/)

3) Calculator (visit site: https://65197a0458a2275218a471b9--euphonious-pavlova-98e8cb.netlify.app/)

These were the three tasks assigned to me. I hope I did them well. I'm open to constructive criticism.
